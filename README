INSTALLATION
------------

The makefile simply copies the contents of the bin and lib directories to the
destination of your choice.

Default usage (installs in /usr/local/lib/crossplex-1.0 and /usr/local/bin):

          make install

Specify target prefix:

          make install DESTDIR=/some/path

Specify individual lib and bin directories:

          make install LIBDIR=/some/path/to/lib BINDIR=/some/path/to/bin


USE
---

The lib directory consists of a set of includable makefiles.  Once you have
installed according to the instructions above, you can include the main.mk file
in your own makefile.  There are a few variables you will need to define in
order to use crossplex's features.  Here is a minimal example:

  # -*- makefile -*-	Example Makefile
  CROSSPLEX_BUILD_SYSTEM := /usr/local/lib/crossplex
  BUILD_TOP        := /absolute/path/to/my/build/directory
  THIRD_PARTY      := $(shell pwd)/third-party  
  PATCHES          := $(shell pwd)/patches
  UNPACKED_SOURCES := $(shell pwd)/unpacked-sources
  include $(CROSSPLEX_BUILD_SYSTEM)/main.mk

That's what you need to have to include the crossplex package.  Now to use it,
you will need to read the documentation.

Have fun!
